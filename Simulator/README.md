## Simulator
### Code and Assets
The code and assets of our simulator is in the `/sdsandbox-master/sdsim` folder of our [simulator repository](https://github.sydney.edu.au/moxu7046/COMP3988_simulator), which is a unity project.

We will not put the code and assets as it is too larget (more than 3GB) to be uploaded here.
